                    <h3> Is the magic shop a true story?</h3>
                <p>The Magic Shop is an English Dystopian Fiction, Science Fiction short story by British writer H.G. Wells. It was first published in 1903. The Magic Shop (1903) offers a boy and his father an incredible afternoon, where allusions and reality fuse magically. "I don't know if you noticed our inscription--the Genuine Magic shop." He drew a business-card from his cheek and handed it to me. "Genuine," he said, with his finger on the word, and added, "There is absolutely no deception, sir."
